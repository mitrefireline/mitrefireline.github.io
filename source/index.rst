========

`fiReLine <https://github.com/mitrefireline>`_ develops machine learning models (deep reinforcement learning or otherwise) capable of determining optimal or near optimal fuel reduction and fire effects strategies, in the domain of wildland firefighting.

With the overall objective of reducing decision timelines, streamlining multiagency logistics, and reducing the overall cost and damage induced by yearly fire seasons.

Repositories
------------
.. `SimHarness <https://mitrefireline.github.io/simharness>`_
..    SimHarness is a modular reinforcement learning harness written in PyTorch made to interact with natural disaster modelers.

`SimFire <https://mitrefireline.github.io/simfire>`_ [`GitHub <https://github.com/mitrefireline/simfire>`_]
    An open-source wildfire simulator written in Python and meant to be used to train reinforcement learning (RL) agents through SimHarness.
